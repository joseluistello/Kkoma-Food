## 1. Domain

### 1.1 Description

**Definition:**

> Domain - A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software. [Domain-Driven Design Reference](http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/reference/), Eric Evans

**Main reason for selecting this domain:**

- I want to have more experience with different domains

The main project entitie are `users` and `products`. A person becomes a `user` by registering.
